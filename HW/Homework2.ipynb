## Question 1
**Problem 1.1 of Moglen (2015)**

What slope would lead to a 1% difference between depth in the vertical plane rather than depth measured perpendicular to the channel bottom? Compare this slope to the observation that a channel slope
of $S_0 = 0.01 m/m$ is generally considered quite steep for open channel
flow.

import numpy as np
angle_rad = np.arccos(1/(1.01))
angle_deg = np.rad2deg(angle_rad)
slope = np.tan(angle_rad)

print('angle (degrees) =', round(angle_deg, 2))
print('slope (m/m) =', round(slope, 2))

A difference of 1% in the vertical plane and the depth perpendicular to the channel bed would lead to a channel slope of 0.14 (m/m). This small difference would create a slope 14 times greater than that of a channel slope of 0.01 m/m.

## Quetion 2
**Problem 1.4 of Moglen (2015)**

The mean or bulk velocity of flow in a stream is observed to be $1.1 m/s$. A rock tossed into this same flow sets up ripples that radiate outward in all directions. It is noted that the ripples propagating directly upstream travel at a velocity of $0.67 m/s$ in the opposite direction to the direction of the flowing stream.


a. What is the Froud number for this flow?
$$
F_r = \frac{v}{\sqrt{gy}}
$$

$$
F_r = \frac{cross-sectionally-averaged-channel-velocity}{celerity-of-a-shallow-water-wave}
$$

Froude_Number = 1.1/(0.67+1.1)
print('Froude Number=', round(Froude_Number,2))

b. Estimate the depth of flow in this stream.

$v_w = \sqrt{gy}$

$y = \frac{v_w^2}{g}$

depth = (1.77**2)/9.81
print('Depth of flow (m)=', round(depth, 2))

## Question 3
Follow the derivation for the celerity of a shallow, small amplitude wave in
chapter 1 of Moglen (2015). Explicitly show all of the steps that lead up to
equation 1.13. Are there any assumptions that seem questionable?

Assuming rectangular channel with width (w) and applying continuity equation

$$
Q_1 = Q_2
$$

$$
v_1*y_1*w = v_2*y_2*w
$$

Dividing both sides of equation by w and substituting $y_{1,2}$ for $v_{1,2} = c - \Delta v$

$$
(c-\Delta v)*(y + \Delta y) = c *y
$$

$$
c*y+c*\Delta y - \Delta v * y - \Delta v * \Delta y = c*y
$$

$\Delta v$ is much smaller than c, and $\Delta y$ is smaller to y and therefore $\Delta v * \Delta y$ can be neglected

$$
\frac{c}{y} = \frac{\Delta v} {\Delta y}
$$

$\Delta y$ is the wave height, and since it is "small", it is treated as negligable. Using Bernoulli's equation, and assuming the pressure remains constant at the begining and ending cross sections

$$
y + \Delta y + \frac{(c-\Delta v)^2}{2g}= y + \frac{c^2}{2g}
$$

$$
y + \Delta y + \frac{c^2-2c*\Delta v +\Delta v^2}{2g}= y + \frac{c^2}{2g}
$$

Again since $\Delta v$ is small $\Delta v^2$ can be neglected on both sides of the equation

$$
\Delta y - \frac{c*\Delta v}{g} = 0
$$

$$
\frac{g}{c} = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta y}
$$

Since $\frac{\Delta v} {\Delta y} = \frac{c}{y} = \frac{g}{c}$

$$
\frac{c}{y}=\frac{g}{c}
$$

$$
\boxed{ 
c = \sqrt{gy}
}
$$

Looking at the work shown in Moglen, I beleive making the assumption that $\Delta v$ and $\Delta y$ are negligable when they are either multiplied or squared could potentially be problematic. If the shallow wave formula is also applied to an area that is not very deep to begin with, the waves depth and celerity become proportionally larger relative to the channels depth and velocity. If this were to happen the prior assumptions are no longer valid in a system of this nature.

## Question 4
In 1960 a massive earthquake shook Chile and generated a tsunami that traveled across the Pacific Ocean (Fig. 1). Use the travel time information in the figure (say the time it took for the wave to hit Hawaii) and what you know
about the speed of long wavelength disturbances (e.g., tsunamis) to estimate
the average depth of the Pacific Ocean.

Figure 1: Map showing the travel time of the tsunami across the Pacific and beyond. Contours are at one-hour intervals. 

**Assume tsunami's wavelength is equal to travel distance \therefore small wave approximation is valid**

small wave approximation: $c=\sqrt{gh}$ or $\frac{distance}{time}=\sqrt{gh}$

$$
h=\frac{(x/t)^2}{g}
$$
Distance from Chile to Hawaii ~ 10,769 km


x = 10769*1000 #distance in m
t = 15*60*60 #time in seconds
g = 9.81

h4 = ((x/t)**2)/g
print("Average depth of Pacific Ocean (m)=", round(h4))

## Question 5
Consider a river with an average bed slope of, $S_o = 0.0002$, a depth of $h = 5 m$ and width of $100 m$. Assume that the flow is **uniform**, and that the velocity distribution over the vertical (the z direction) can be adequately described from $\frac{z}{h} = 0.001$ to 1 by: 

$$
\frac{u}{u_o} = \frac{1}{k} ln(\frac{z}{z'})+8.5
$$

where $u_o$ is the friction or shear velocity, $κ = 0.4$ is the von Karman constant, and $z'$ is the roughness length scale. For this problem, take $z' = 0.05$, and assume that the uniform flow equation $u_0 = \sqrt{ghS_o}$ is valid. Use this information to calculate the following:

(a) volumetric flow rate, Q

(b) depth-average velocity, V

(c) Reynolds number, Re

(d) Froude number, Fr

State any assumptions you make in the process

#### (a) volumetric flow rate, Q
$$
Q = qw 
$$

$$
q= \int_{z}^{} u \,dz\
$$

Limits of integration: z/h = 0.001 to 1 or z= 0.005 to 5

$$
q= \int_{0.005}^{5} u \,dz\
$$

$$
u = \frac{\sqrt{ghS_o}}{k} ln(\frac{z}{z'})+8.5\sqrt{ghS_o}
$$

$$
q = \int_{0.005}^{5} \frac{\sqrt{ghS_o}}{k} ln(\frac{z}{z'})+8.5\sqrt{ghS_o} \, dz\
$$

$$
Q = qw
$$

**Assuming rectangular channel area** $A=wh= 5m(100m)= 500m^2$

from scipy.integrate import quad
import numpy as np

# Define Parameters 
g = 9.81
h = 5
S = 0.0002
k = 0.4
z = 0.05
w= 100

# definning function
def integrand(x):
    return (np.sqrt(g * h * S) / k) * np.log(x / z) + 8.5 * np.sqrt(g * h * S)

# integrating equation
q_5, error = quad(integrand, 0.001, 1)

# Print q
#print("Result of integration:", q_5)
#print("Estimated absolute error:", error)

# Solving for Q
Q5 = q_5*w
print("Q (m/s^2)=", Q5)

#### (b) depth-average velocity, V
$$
u = \frac{\sqrt{ghS_o}}{k} ln(\frac{z}{z'})+8.5\sqrt{ghS_o}
$$

print("depth averaged velocity (m/s)=", round(q_5, 2))

#### (c) Reynolds number, Re
$$
R_e = \frac{vg}{v}
$$

u = q_5
visc = 1.004*10**(-6) #m2/s
g = 9.81

R_e = (u*g)/visc

print("Renyolds Number =", round(R_e, 2))

#### (d) Froud number, Fr
$$
F_r = \frac{v}{\sqrt{gy}}
$$

u = q_5
g = 9.81
y = 5

F_r = (u/((g*y)**0.5))

print("Renyolds Number =", round(F_r, 2))

## Question 6
**(Graduate Students Only)** Explain the relationship between the Reynolds
Averaged Navier-Stokes equations, the Shallow Water equations, and the Saint
Venant equations.



## Question 7
**(Graduate Students Only)** Start with the conservative form of the Saint Venant equations and show all steps needed to put the equation in the non-conservative form. Hint, use the following
$$
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = A\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
$$

$$
\frac{\partial(Ah_c)}{\partial x} = A\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}
$$

where $B$ is the top width of the channel and $h_c$ is the distance from the water surface to the centroid of the cross section.

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( \beta \cdot \frac{Q^2}{A} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (g \cdot h_c \cdot A) = g \cdot A \cdot (S_o - S_f)
$$

$\downarrow$

$ \beta = 1 , Q = VA $

$$\downarrow$$

$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(\frac{vvAA}{A} \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (g \cdot h_c \cdot A) = g \cdot A \cdot (S_o - S_f)
$$

$$\downarrow$$

$$
\frac{\partial vA}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(vQ \right) + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} (g \cdot h_c \cdot A) = g \cdot A \cdot (S_o - S_f)
$$

$\downarrow$

$$\downarrow$$

$$
v \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + A \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} + Q \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+ g \frac{\partial (h_c \cdot A)}{\partial x} + h_c \cdot A \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = g \cdot A \cdot (S_o -S_f)
$$

$\downarrow$

$\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = A\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial(Ah_c)}{\partial x} = A\frac{\partial y}{\partial x}$

$$\downarrow$$

$$
v \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + A \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} + Q \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+ g \frac{\partial (h_c \cdot A)}{\partial x} + h_c \cdot A \frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = g \cdot A \cdot (S_o -S_f)
$$

$\downarrow$

$\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0$ $\therefore v\frac{\partial A}{\partial t}+v\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0$

$$
A \frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + Q\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+g \cdot A \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} + h_c \cdot A\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = g \cdot A(S_o -S_f) 
$$

$\downarrow$

Divide by A

$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + v\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+g \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} + h_c\frac{\partial g}{\partial x} = g \cdot A(S_o -S_f) 
$$



$$
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} + g \frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = g (S_o-S_f)
$$
